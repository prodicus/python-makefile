## python-makefile

Ohk, I gotta admit it. 

I have started to â™¥ _GNU_ _[make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)_ utility because I use it one too many times apparantly!

**Notes**: This makefile has a long way to go. Do take a peek inside before running anything as I have made this to suit my needs(`python` centric mostly).
